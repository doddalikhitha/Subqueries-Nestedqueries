# Subqueries and Nested Queries
## About This Task
This task is part of my SQL Developer Internship learning journey.  
Since I am still learning SQL, I used this task to practice writing different types of subqueries.  
The queries may not be advanced or optimized, but they helped me understand the logic better.

## What I Learned
- How to write simple subqueries inside WHERE.
- The difference between IN, NOT IN, and EXISTS.
- What a *scalar subquery* is (returns a single value).
- How a *correlated subquery* works (query inside depends on outer query).
- How to use a subquery in the FROM clause (derived table).

## How I Practiced
- I created queries on my LibraryDB with Books, Members, Loans, and Staff tables.
- I tried examples like finding the book with maximum copies, members with multiple loans, and staff who issued books.
- I tested my queries in DB Browser / MySQL Workbench.

## Notes
- Some queries could be written using JOIN instead of subqueries, but I kept them in subquery format for practice.
- As I continue learning, I plan to improve queryÂ optimization.
